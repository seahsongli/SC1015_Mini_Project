# SC1015_Mini_Project - Formula 1 Top 3 Predictor for Qualifying Races
---

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying the top 3 drivers in Formula 1 races. Leveraging machine learning techniques and data analysis, we explore patterns and trends in historical Formula 1 data to predict the top performers in qualifying races.

## Features
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and encode categorical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and trends in the dataset.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest.
- Upsampling techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:seahsongli/SC1015_Mini_Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SC1015_Mini_Project`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Prepare your Formula 1 dataset in CSV format.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Formula1_Top3_Predictor.ipynb` to execute the code cells and train the predictive model.
3. Analyze the model performance and evaluate the results using the provided metrics.
